# An low-code way to predict cotton prices—Azure ML Designer

*Have you ever been afraid of writing code, dealing with incorrect data, or studying ML algorithms? **Your work will be easy with Azure ML Designer!***

The designer provides a great approach with low code solutions that help the coders the non coders to work and build models with minimal knowledge.

The blog will give a small example of implementing the model using the designer which provides the drag and drop options for convenient model building and evaluations.

## The dataset

The dataset is a crop with respective price values. We would try to build a model to predict the cotton prices from the given dataset.
Will look at the patterns and relations that it forms with other dataset.

The dataset is available at (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kianwee/agricultural-raw-material-prices-19902020).

But we want this to be challenging, leaving the dataset to you for implementing on your own.


## Let's see the simple implementation of a sample dataset in designer

The dataset is automobile price prediction, and its just a sample dataset. 

The completed path will look like this ...

The run overview are overview log and some data over the present pipeline run.

The evaluation and more details

The model has it own details and run logs in train tab in designer ...

## Do some exercise

Take the above dataset, work on the designer. Drag and drop the required tags and work around with the analysis with the visuals provided by the evaluation part.

One of the best implementation of such solutions can be powered by the Azure Cloud and with the advancement of prediction capabilities using machine learning and deep learning in the domain of AI.
